# **Chapter 1 - Vectors**

## **1.1 Vectors**

### **Sparsity**
A vector is said to be sparse if many of its entries are zero; its *sparsity pattern* is the set of indices of nonzero entries.

## **1.2 Vector addition**
All are intuitive.

## **1.3 Scalar-vector multiplication**

### **Linear combination of unit vectors**
We can write any $n$-vector $b$ as a linear combination of the standard unit vectors, as
$$
b = b_1e_1 + \dots + b_ne_n
$$

### **Special linear combinations**
When the coefficients sum to one $i.e., \beta_1 + \dots + \beta_m = 1$, the linear combination is called an *affine combination*. When the coefficients in an affine combination are nonnegative, it is called a *convex combination*, a *mixture*, or a *weighted average*.

## **1.4 Inner product**
### **General examples**
- Unit Vector: $e_i^Ta = a_i$
- Sum: $\bold{1}^Ta = a_1 + \dots + a_n$
- Sum of squares: $a^Ta = a_1^2 + \dots + a_n^2$
